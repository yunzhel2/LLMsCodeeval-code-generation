{"title":"B. Buses","description":"Little boy Gerald studies at school which is quite far from his house. That's why he has to go there by bus every day. The way from home to school is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly n+1 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to n in the order in which they follow from Gerald's home. The bus stop by Gerald's home has number 0 and the bus stop by the school has number n.There are m buses running between the house and the school: the i-th bus goes from stop si to ti (si<ti), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order in which they follow on the segment. Besides, Gerald's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the school (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, Gerald can get on the i-th bus on any stop numbered from si to ti-1 inclusive, but he can get off the i-th bus only on the bus stop ti.Gerald can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the school to the house.Gerald wants to know how many ways he has to get from home to school.

Laharl, Etna and Flonne occupy some positions on the half-line and they want to get to the position with the largest possible number. They are originally placed in different positions. Each of the characters can perform each of the following actions no more than once:   Move a certain distance.  Grab another character and lift him above the head.  Throw the lifted character a certain distance.  Each character has a movement range parameter. They can only move to free positions, assuming that distance between those positions doesn't exceed the movement range. One character can lift another character if the distance between the two characters equals 1, and no one already holds that another character. We can assume that the lifted character moves to the same position as the person who has lifted him, and the position in which he stood before becomes free. A lifted character cannot perform any actions and the character that holds him cannot walk. Also, each character has a throwing range parameter. It is the distance at which this character can throw the one lifted above his head. He can only throw a character to a free position, and only when there is a lifted character.

{"title":"C. Digital Root","description":"Not long ago Billy came across such a problem, where there were given three natural numbers A, B and C from the range [1,N], and it was asked to check whether the equation AB=C is correct. Recently Billy studied the concept of a digital root of a number. We should remind you that a digital root d(x) of the number x is the sum s(x) of all the digits of this number, if s(x)\u22649, otherwise it is d(s(x)). For example, a digital root of the number 6543 is calculated as follows: d(6543)=d(6+5+4+3)=d(18)=9. Billy has counted that the digital root of a product of numbers is equal to the digital root of the product of the factors' digital roots, i.e. d(xy)=d(d(x)d(y)). And the following solution to the problem came to his mind: to calculate the digital roots and check if this condition is met. However, Billy has doubts that this condition is sufficient. That's why he asks you to find out the amount of test examples for the given problem such that the algorithm proposed by Billy makes mistakes.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","time_limit":"2 seconds","memory_limit":"256 megabytes","input_spec":"The first line contains the only number N (1\u2264N\u226410^6).\n","output_spec":"Output one number \u2014 the amount of required A, B and C from the range [1,N].\n","notes":"For the first sample the required triples are (3,4,3) and (4,3,3).\n","sample_inputs":["4\n","5\n"],"sample_outputs":["2\n","6\n"],"id":"10-C","difficulty":2000,"tags":["number+theory"],"src_uid":"fc133fe6353089a0ebee08dec919f608"}

Clock shows time in decimal number system, in format H:M, where the string H always has a fixed length equal to the number of digits in the decimal representation of number h-1. To achieve this, leading zeros are added if necessary. The string M has a similar format, and its length is always equal to the number of digits in the decimal representation of number m-1. For example, if h=17, m=1000, then time equal to 13 hours and 75 minutes will be displayed as \"13:075\".Vasya had been watching the clock from h1 hours m1 minutes to h2 hours m2 minutes inclusive, and then he fell asleep.

{"title":"B. Piet","description":"Piet is one of the most known visual esoteric programming languages. The programs in Piet are constructed from colorful blocks of pixels and interpreted using pretty complicated rules. In this problem we will use a subset of Piet language with simplified rules.The program will be a rectangular image consisting of colored and black pixels. The color of each pixel will be given by an integer number between 0 and 9, inclusive, with 0 denoting black. A block of pixels is defined as a rectangle of pixels of the same color (not black). It is guaranteed that all connected groups of colored pixels of the same color will form rectangular blocks. Groups of black pixels can form arbitrary shapes.The program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer (IP) which consists of three parts: current block pointer (BP); note that there is no concept of current pixel within the block; direction pointer (DP) which can point left, right, up or down; block chooser (CP) which can point to the left or to the right from the direction given by DP; in absolute values CP can differ from DP by 90 degrees counterclockwise or clockwise, respectively.Initially BP points to the block which contains the top-left corner of the program, DP points to the right, and CP points to the left (see the orange square on the image below).One step of program interpretation changes the state of IP in a following way. The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the current color block in the direction of the DP. From all pixels that form this edge, the interpreter selects the furthest one in the direction of CP. After this, BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the direction of DP. If the next pixel belongs to a colored block, this block becomes the current one, and two other parts of IP stay the same. It the next pixel is black or outside of the program, BP stays the same but two other parts of IP change. If CP was pointing to the left, now it points to the right, and DP stays the same. If CP was pointing to the right, now it points to the left, and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.This way BP will never point to a black block (it is guaranteed that top-left pixel of the program will not be black).You are given a Piet program.

{"title":"A. Help Farmer","description":"Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sam the Farmer. Sam had a cow named Dawn and he was deeply attached to her. Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored A\u00b7B\u00b7C hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped A layers high. Each layer had B rows and each row had C blocks.At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer. Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A-1)\u00d7(B-2)\u00d7(C-2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1\u00d71\u00d71 blocks and scattered them around the barn.

{"title":"D. Help Shrek and Donkey 2","description":"Having learned (not without some help from the Codeforces participants) to play the card game from the previous round optimally, Shrek and Donkey (as you may remember, they too live now in the Kingdom of Far Far Away) have decided to quit the boring card games and play with toy soldiers.The rules of the game are as follows: there is a battlefield, its size equals n\u00d7m squares, some squares contain the toy soldiers (the green ones belong to Shrek and the red ones belong to Donkey). Besides, each of the n lines of the area contains not more than two soldiers. During a move a players should select not less than 1 and not more than k soldiers belonging to him and make them either attack or retreat.An attack is moving all of the selected soldiers along the lines on which they stand in the direction of an enemy soldier, if he is in this line. If this line doesn't have an enemy soldier, then the selected soldier on this line can move in any direction during the player's move. Each selected soldier has to move at least by one cell. Different soldiers can move by a different number of cells. During the attack the soldiers are not allowed to cross the cells where other soldiers stand (or stood immediately before the attack). It is also not allowed to go beyond the battlefield or finish the attack in the cells, where other soldiers stand (or stood immediately before attack).A retreat is moving all of the selected soldiers along the lines on which they stand in the direction from an enemy soldier, if he is in this line. The other rules repeat the rules of the attack.For example, let's suppose that the original battlefield had the form (here symbols \"G\" mark Shrek's green soldiers and symbols \"R\" mark Donkey's red ones):  -G-R--R-G- Let's suppose that k=2 and Shrek moves first. If he decides to attack, then after his move the battlefield can look like that:  --GR-     --GR-     -G-R--RG--     -R-G-     -RG-- If in the previous example Shrek decides to retreat, then after his move the battlefield can look like that:  G--R-     G--R-     -G-R--R--G     -R-G-     -R--G On the other hand, the followings fields cannot result from Shrek's correct move:  G--R-     ---RG     --GR--RG--     -R-G-     GR--- Shrek starts the game. To make a move means to attack or to retreat by the rules. A player who cannot make a move loses and his opponent is the winner. Determine the winner of the given toy soldier game if Shrek and Donkey continue to be under the yellow pills from the last rounds' problem.

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called \"R2:D2\". What can \"R2:D2\" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as \"a:b\", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive).

A correct bracket sequence is the sequence of opening (\"(\") and closing (\")\") brackets, such that it is possible to obtain a correct mathematical expression from it, inserting numbers and operators between the brackets. For example, such sequences as \"(())()\" and \"()\" are correct bracket sequences and such sequences as \")()\" and \"(()\" are not.In a correct bracket sequence each bracket corresponds to the matching bracket (an opening bracket corresponds to the matching closing bracket and vice versa). For example, in a bracket sequence shown of the figure below, the third bracket corresponds to the matching sixth one and the fifth bracket corresponds to the fourth one.  You are allowed to color some brackets in the bracket sequence so as all three conditions are fulfilled:   Each bracket is either not colored any color, or is colored red, or is colored blue.  For any pair of matching brackets exactly one of them is colored. In other words, for any bracket the following is true: either it or the matching bracket that corresponds to it is colored.  No two neighboring colored brackets have the same color. Find the number of different ways to color the bracket sequence. The ways should meet the above-given conditions.

Then they make moves in turn. The first participant moves first, naturally. During a move, the first participant can transfer from the point x to any integer point of the interval [x+a; x+b].

The figure below shows the clever construction. A more formal description of the clever construction is as follows. The clever construction consists of n rows with scales. The first row has n scales, the second row has (n-1) scales, the i-th row has (n-i+1) scales, the last row has exactly one scale. Let's number the scales in each row from the left to the right, starting from 1. Then the value of wi,k in kilograms (1\u2264i\u2264n;\u00a01\u2264k\u2264n-i+1) is the weight capacity parameter of the k-th scale in the i-th row. If a body whose mass is not less than wi,k falls on the scale with weight capacity wi,k, then the scale breaks. At that anything that the scale has on it, either falls one level down to the left (if possible) or one level down to the right (if possible). In other words, if the scale wi,k (i<n) breaks, then there are at most two possible variants in which the contents of the scale's pan can fall out: all contents of scale wi,k falls either on scale wi+1,k-1 (if it exists), or on scale wi+1,k (if it exists). If scale wn,1 breaks, then all its contents falls right in the Fat Rat's claws. Please note that the scales that are the first and the last in a row, have only one variant of dropping the contents.Initially, oats are simultaneously put on all scales of the first level.

{"title":"B. Special Olympics","description":"A renowned abstract artist Sasha, drawing inspiration from nowhere, decided to paint a picture entitled \"Special Olympics\". He justly thought that, if the regular Olympic games have five rings, then the Special ones will do with exactly two rings just fine.Let us remind you that a ring is a region located between two concentric circles with radii r and R (r<R). These radii are called internal and external, respectively. Concentric circles are circles with centers located at the same point.Soon a white canvas, which can be considered as an infinite Cartesian plane, had two perfect rings, painted with solid black paint. As Sasha is very impulsive, the rings could have different radii and sizes, they intersect and overlap with each other in any way.

The cuttings are made perpendicularly to the side along which the length is measured. Thus the cuttings do not change the width of a stripe but each of the resulting pieces has a lesser length (the sum of which is equal to the length of the initial stripe)After all the cuttings the blinds are constructed through consecutive joining of several parts, similar in length, along sides, along which length is measured. Also, apart from the resulting pieces an initial stripe can be used as a blind if it hasn't been cut. It is forbidden to construct blinds in any other way.Thus, if the blinds consist of k pieces each d in length, then they are of form of a rectangle of k\u00d7d bourlemeters.

This year Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around and bears its own noble name \u2014 The Huff-puffer.So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he fills the petrol tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol (\u03b1\u226510 is Vanya's favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with \u03b1 liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. For example, if \u03b1=43.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42+43.21=49.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63+43.21=52.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. You won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins.

These verteces are deleted together with their edges (which are incident to at least one of the vertices a or b) but a new vertex w is added together with edges (x,w) for each edge (a,w) and\/or (b,w). If there was the edge (a,b) it transforms to the loop (w,w). The resulting graph (after the merging operation) may contain multiple (parallel) edges between pairs of vertices and loops. Let us note that this operation decreases the number of vertices of graph by 1 but leaves the number of edges in the graph unchanged.The merging operation can be informally described as a unity of two vertices of the graph into one with the natural transformation of the graph edges.You may apply this operation consecutively and make the given graph to be a caterpillar.

The resulting task is even more challenging than the classic puzzle: now all the fragments have the same rectangular shape, and one can assemble the puzzle only relying on the picture drawn on the pieces.All puzzle pieces turn out to be of the same size X\u00d7Y, because the picture is cut first by horizontal cuts with the pitch of X, then with vertical cuts with the pitch of Y.

He was great at everything including Combinatorics, Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, Calculus, etc. He was not only smart but extraordinarily fast! He could manage to sum 10^18 numbers in a single second.One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part.In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The i-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the i-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the i-th digit of the answer is 0.Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length \u221e (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too. He is a good fellow so he won't give anyone very big numbers and he always gives one person numbers of same length.Now you are going to take part in Shapur's contest.

It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types. That's why a question arises: \"Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer n?\"Petya knows only 5 integer types:1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from -128 to 1272) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from -32768 to 327673) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from -2147483648 to 21474836474) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 92233720368547758075) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.For all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value range.From this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer n.

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8\u00d78 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements.It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything \u2014 for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs.

{"title":"B. Memory Manager","description":"There is little time left before the release of the first national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not finished yet \u2014 the memory manager is among them. According to the developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:   alloc n \u2014 to allocate n bytes of the memory and return the allocated block's identifier x;  erase x \u2014 to erase the block with the identifier x;  defragment \u2014 to defragment the free memory, bringing all the blocks as close to the beginning of the memory as possible and preserving their respective order; The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first to the m-th.The first operation alloc n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free block of n successive bytes is being allocated in the memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free block of this size, the function returns NULL.The second operation erase x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT.The last operation defragment does not have any arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order.In the current implementation you are to use successive integers, starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration.You are to write the implementation of the memory manager.

{"title":"E. Defining Macros","description":"Most C\/C++ programmers know about excellent opportunities that preprocessor #define directives give; but many know as well about the problems that can arise because of their careless use.In this problem we consider the following model of #define constructions (also called macros). Each macro has its name and value. The generic syntax for declaring a macro is the following:#define macro_name macro_valueAfter the macro has been declared, \"macro_name\" is replaced with \"macro_value\" each time it is met in the program (only the whole tokens can be replaced; i.e. \"macro_name\" is replaced only when it is surrounded by spaces or other non-alphabetic symbol). A \"macro_value\" within our model can only be an arithmetic expression consisting of variables, four arithmetic operations, brackets, and also the names of previously declared macros (in this case replacement is performed sequentially). The process of replacing macros with their values is called substitution.One of the main problems arising while using macros \u2014 the situation when as a result of substitution we get an arithmetic expression with the changed order of calculation because of different priorities of the operations.Let's consider the following example. Say, we declared such a #define construction:#define sum x + yand further in the program the expression \"2 * sum\" is calculated. After macro substitution is performed we get \"2 * x + y\", instead of intuitively expected \"2 * (x + y)\".Let's call the situation \"suspicious\", if after the macro substitution the order of calculation changes, falling outside the bounds of some macro. Thus, your task is to find out by the given set of #define definitions and the given expression if this expression is suspicious or not.Let's speak more formally. We should perform an ordinary macros substitution in the given expression. Moreover, we should perform a \"safe\" macros substitution in the expression, putting in brackets each macro value; after this, guided by arithmetic rules of brackets expansion, we can omit some of the brackets. If there exist a way to get an expression, absolutely coinciding with the expression that is the result of an ordinary substitution (character-by-character, but ignoring spaces), then this expression and the macros system are called correct, otherwise \u2014 suspicious.Note that we consider the \"\/\" operation as the usual mathematical division, not the integer division like in C\/C++. That's why, for example, in the expression \"a*(b\/c)\" we can omit brackets to get the expression \"a*b\/c\".","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","time_limit":"3 seconds","memory_limit":"256 megabytes","input_spec":"The first line contains the only number n (0\u2264n\u2264100) \u2014 the amount of #define constructions in the given program.\nThen there follow n lines, each of them contains just one #define construction.

What is special about this very cashier is that it can serve two customers simultaneously. However, if two customers need ai and aj of time to be served, the time needed to work with both of them customers is equal to max(ai,aj). Please note that working with customers is an uninterruptable process, and therefore, if two people simultaneously come to the cashier, it means that they begin to be served simultaneously, and will both finish simultaneously (it is possible that one of them will have to wait).Vasya used in his algorithm an ingenious heuristic \u2014 as long as the queue has more than one person waiting, then some two people of the first three standing in front of the queue are sent simultaneously. If the queue has only one customer number i, then he goes to the cashier, and is served within ai of time. Note that the total number of phases of serving a customer will always be equal to \u2308n\/2\u2309.Vasya thinks that this method will help to cope with the queues we all hate.

Each general asks some fee from the king for managing towers. As they live in a really far away kingdom, each general evaluates his fee in the following weird manner: he finds two remotest (the most distant) towers, where the soldiers of his army are situated and asks for the fee equal to the distance. Each tower is represented by a point on the plane with coordinates (x,y), and the distance between two points with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is determined in this kingdom as |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|.The greedy king was not exactly satisfied with such a requirement from the generals, that's why he only agreed to pay one fee for two generals, equal to the maximum of two demanded fees.

We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.

All the strings of beads have a small fastener, and if one unfastens it, one might notice that all the strings of beads in the shop are of the same length. Because of the peculiarities of the Martian eyesight, if Zorg sees one blue-and-red string of beads first, and then the other with red beads instead of blue ones, and blue \u2014 instead of red, he regards these two strings of beads as identical. In other words, Zorg regards as identical not only those strings of beads that can be derived from each other by the string turnover, but as well those that can be derived from each other by a mutual replacement of colours and\/or by the string turnover.It is known that all Martians are very orderly, and if a Martian sees some amount of objects, he tries to put them in good order.

{"title":"C. Candies","description":"After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of $$$n$$$ candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer $$$k$$$, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats $$$k$$$ candies from the box (if there are less than $$$k$$$ candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats $$$10\\%$$$ of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats\u00a0\u2014 next day Vasya eats $$$k$$$ candies again, and Petya\u00a0\u2014 $$$10\\%$$$ of the candies left in a box, and so on.If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by $$$10$$$, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were $$$97$$$ candies in the box, Petya would eat only $$$9$$$ of them. In particular, if there are less than $$$10$$$ candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all.Your task is to find out the minimal amount of $$$k$$$ that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the $$$n$$$ candies he initially got.

Hexadecimal's Numbers","description":"One beautiful July morning a terrible thing happened in Mainframe: a mean virus Megabyte somehow got access to the memory of his not less mean sister Hexadecimal. He loaded there a huge amount of n different natural numbers from 1 to n to obtain total control over her energy.But his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn't perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.","input_from":"standard input","output_to":"standard output","time_limit":"1 second","memory_limit":"64 megabytes","input_spec":"Input data contains the only number n (1\u2264n\u226410^9).\n","output_spec":"Output the only number \u2014 answer to the problem.\n","notes":"For n = 10 the answer includes numbers 1 and 10.\n","sample_inputs":["10\n"],"sample_outputs":["2"],"id":"9-C","difficulty":1200,"tags":["brute+force","implementation","math"],"src_uid":"64a842f9a41f85a83b7d65bfbe21b6cb"}
{"title":"D. How many trees?","description":"In one very old text file there was written Great Wisdom. This Wisdom was so Great that nobody could decipher it, even Phong \u2014 the oldest among the inhabitants of Mainframe. But still he managed to get some information from there. For example, he managed to learn that User launches games for pleasure \u2014 and then terrible Game Cubes fall down on the city, bringing death to those modules, who cannot win the game...For sure, as guard Bob appeared in Mainframe many modules stopped fearing Game Cubes. Because Bob (as he is alive yet) has never been defeated by User, and he always meddles with Game Cubes, because he is programmed to this.However, unpleasant situations can happen, when a Game Cube falls down on Lost Angles. Because there lives a nasty virus \u2014 Hexadecimal, who is... mmm... very strange. And she likes to play very much. So, willy-nilly, Bob has to play with her first, and then with User.This time Hexadecimal invented the following entertainment: Bob has to leap over binary search trees with n nodes. We should remind you that a binary search tree is a binary tree, each node has a distinct key, for each node the following is true: the left sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, the right sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. All the keys are different positive integer numbers from 1 to n. Each node of such a tree can have up to two children, or have no children at all (in the case when a node is a leaf).In Hexadecimal's game all the trees are different, but the height of each is not lower than h. In this problem \u00abheight\u00bb stands for the maximum amount of nodes on the way from the root to the remotest leaf, the root node and the leaf itself included. When Bob leaps over a tree, it disappears. Bob gets the access to a Cube, when there are no trees left. He knows how many trees he will have to leap over in the worst case.
